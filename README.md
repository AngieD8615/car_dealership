# Vehicle Comparison Tool in...REACT

## Summary

You were tasked to create a car dealership management tool for a used car dealer with multiple locations.

The base goals of this project will create a basic vehicle inventory management tool. The stretch goals will add customer and purchase management, as well, making it a pretty solid dealer management software. (Not that I know how to run a dealership. I'm a dev. What do I know...)

> NOTE: You won't want to fork this repo, as it could be subject to alterations and/or additions as time goes on.
